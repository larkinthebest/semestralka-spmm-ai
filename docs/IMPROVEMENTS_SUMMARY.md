**Example Response:**
```
## Test Preparation 📝

I'll create a test on **[topic]** from your file. First, let me clarify:

**Which test format would you prefer?**
• Multiple choice questions
• True/False statements  
• Short answer questions
• Mixed format (combination of all)

**How many questions?** (I recommend 5-10)

Please let me know your preferences! 🎯
