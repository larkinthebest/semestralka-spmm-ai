## 5. Franklin's Improved File Access 🐛

Now, Franklin remembers all files used in the current chat!

### How It Works
1. Start with **Enola** (Explanation Mode)
2. Upload files and ask questions
3. Switch to **Franklin** (Testing Mode)
4. Franklin automatically sees all files from the chat
5. No need to re-upload or re-attach!

### Example Flow
```
[Enola Mode]
You: Upload "biology_notes.pdf"
You: "Explain photosynthesis"
Enola: [Detailed explanation using the file]

[Switch to Franklin]
You: "Test me on photosynthesis"
Franklin: ✅ Sees biology_notes.pdf automatically
Franklin: "I'll create a test! First, what format do you prefer?"
```
