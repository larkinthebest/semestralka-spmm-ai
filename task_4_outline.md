## Task 4: Solving a Differential Equation

**Problem Statement:**
Solve the following second-order linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients:
51108x''(t) - 3x'(t) + 2x(t) = 2e^{3t}51108
with initial conditions:
51108x(0+) = 051108
51108x'(0+) = 051108

**Solution:**
The solution to the differential equation is:
51108x(t) = e^t - 2e^{2t} + e^{3t}51108

This task involves finding the solution to a non-homogeneous second-order linear ordinary differential equation using methods such as finding the complementary solution and a particular solution, and then applying initial conditions.
