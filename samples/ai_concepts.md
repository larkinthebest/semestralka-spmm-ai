# Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals

## Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents one of the most significant technological advances of our time.

## Core Concepts

### Machine Learning
- **Supervised Learning**: Learning with labeled examples
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data  
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through trial and error

### Deep Learning
Neural networks with multiple layers that can:
1. Process complex patterns
2. Handle large datasets
3. Achieve human-level performance in specific tasks

### Applications
- Healthcare: Medical diagnosis and drug discovery
- Transportation: Autonomous vehicles
- Education: Personalized learning systems
- Entertainment: Content recommendation

## Testing Questions
1. What is the difference between AI and Machine Learning?
2. Name three types of machine learning approaches.
3. How can AI be applied in education?
